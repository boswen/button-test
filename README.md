# button test
Simple test of a site entrance button on a splash page. Extracted from main project with intent to create a minimal, reproducible example of a code problem I can't seem to figure out. In short, I'm trying to get a short audio clip to play on this hold-to-activate button when tapped on mobile, but it only works on the *second* tap, and I don't know why. (Code works fine on desktop.). I understand the mobile browser restriction of "no autoplay", but if I get a user gesture (i.e. the tap and hold), how do I reliably trigger the sound on the first tap?
